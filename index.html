        <h2>Medieval Period</h2>
        <p>
            The Middle Ages see to the rise of more technological growth, which replace labor and artisans. Due to economic instability, there was a general
            hostility to new technology. Guilds and authorities often banned/suppressed innovations to protect workers, but mechanization still continued gradually...

        <p>
            From the 16th to 18th century, innovations in textiles, steam power, and metallurgy reshaped industries and accelerated job displacement. 
            A rise in mercantalism grew, particularly in Britain, where the thought that improved technologies would allow for more employment, because
            Britain would be able to defend itself against foreign markets. As such, government prioritized efficiency and would not protect workers
            from unemployment like they had in the past.

        <h2>1800s</h2>
        <p>
            The 1800s saw intense debates over technological unemployment. Some, such as Malthus, warned that mechanization could cause long term job loss, while others, such as 
            Jean-Baptiste Say, argued that workers would naturally find new jobs as the market adjusted. During the mid-1800s, Marx joined the debate, and took a deeply pessimistic view.
            He claimed that automation would ultimately, exploit workers. However, by the late 1800s, economic growth for all classes led to a dismissal of job loss.
